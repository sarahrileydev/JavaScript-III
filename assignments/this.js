* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. When used globally, "this" points towards the window as the Object.
* 2. When used implicitally, "this" points towards the object preceding the dot in a function invocation.
* 3. When used to create new Objects via a constructor function, "this" refers to the specific use that gets passed through the constructor function.
* 4. When used explicitly, "this" is defined inside the call() or apply() method.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
